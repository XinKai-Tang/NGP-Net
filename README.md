## Introduction
We propose NGP-Net, a novel W-shaped deep learning architecture specifically designed for dynamic nodule growth prediction by directly modelling irregularly spaced longitudinal CT data. Unlike previous methods reliant on fixed growth metrics such as volumetric or mass-change rates, NGP-Net innovatively integrates temporal sensitivity into its predictive framework through a Spatial-Temporal Encoding Module (STEM) based on dilated depthwise separable convolutions. Furthermore, NGP-Net employs a dual-branch decoder to reconstruct high-fidelity textures and shapes of nodules at arbitrary future time intervals, significantly enhancing interpretability and clinical applicability. 


## The PNG Dataset
Under the premise of strictly adhering to medical ethics principles, we collect a practical follow-up dataset, named **Pulmonary Nodule Growth (PNG)**, for pulmonary nodules with our cooperating hospital. The dataset contains *378* chest CT scans from $103$ patients with a total of *226* long-standing pulmonary nodules. Each nodule has at least three time-points of follow-up records, with an interval between $2$ and $64$ months, and all the nodules are annotated and checked by seven radiologists. Further details about PNG dataset can be found in [KAGGLE](https://kaggle.com/datasets/eb40d82b3bdd92bcdd202c50092443a8280a039f70fd96f2ad0cbc988ae57ca7).

## Prediction Results

### Overall Performance
Comparison of methods in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Sensitivity (SEN), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity (SSIM), and Mean Square Errors in overall (MSE<sub>ROI</sub>) and nodule (MSE<sub>PN</sub>) regions. The values (described in "mean ± standard deviation") in the table are obtained by averaging the 5-fold cross-validation results, respectively.
